# A-Link-Between-Fists

A 2D arena brawler in the sytle of the 1987 Legend of Zelda.

## Purpose

This project is designed to familiarize the contributers to concepts within software engineering. Everything from planning to releases. The project is also designed to challenge the programming capabilities of the contributers by having us work on programming concepts we have not tackled before, like game loops and custome UIs.

## Compiling and running

After cloning, compile using javac and run with java.

Linux:
```bash
javac src/application/LinkBetweenFists.java

## Contributing

Because this is a school project and will be using licensed art assets, after the conclusion of the course this repository will no longer be worked on. If anyone finding it wishes to clone it and use the code as a base for their own game, please feel free.
